  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the <strong>Brighton Student Market</strong> — your trusted university marketplace.</p>

  <p>
    At the Brighton Student Market, we intend to change the way students at the University of Brighton buy, sell, 
    and interact with each other within our community. Our main goal is to make students' lives easier by providing 
    a service that promotes more affordable and sustainable alternatives to the big-name online marketplaces — 
    run by students, for students.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Brighton Student Market, we're redefining the way students connect, buy, and sell within their university 
    communities. Born out of a simple idea — to make student life easier, more affordable, and more sustainable — 
    our platform serves as a central hub for students to exchange goods, services, and opportunities.
  </p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    We are all students at Brighton University and developers working to support our peers through the challenges 
    of independent living. We've been through the same struggles — forgetting essentials at home, not knowing 
    where to buy replacements — and that's why we created this marketplace. It's tailored to university life 
    and encourages sustainability by giving items a second life at student-friendly prices.
  </p>

    <li><strong>Buy and sell locally:</strong> From textbooks and electronics to furniture and dorm essentials — find what you need or sell what you don’t, all within the university community.</li>
    <li><strong>A verified community:</strong> Listings and profiles are tied to your university email for added trust and safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainable choices:</strong> Promote reuse and reduce waste by extending the life of your items.</li>
  </ul>
